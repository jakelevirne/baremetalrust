We'll be following along with [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book). The first few chapters of this book can be completed without any additional hardware by using QEMU, as outlined in the book. You can order an [STM32F3DISCOVERY](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html) from any of the top 3 electronics distributors (I don't get any compensation for these links):
